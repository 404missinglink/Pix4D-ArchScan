Bhiwandi Bypass is a 26 km long part of NH160 or Mumbai-Nashik Highway. As this highway connects with multiple roads and only road to connect Mumbai to Nashik, always traffic congestion occurs there. 
So this 4 lane highway is being widened into a 8-lane highway with 4 lane service roads.
in this video you will see the current progress of this Road Widening Project.
